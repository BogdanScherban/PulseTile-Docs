# Bower in PulseTile

Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff youâ€™re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, <a href="https://github.com/PulseTile/PulseTile/blob/develop/bower.json">bower.json</a>.
