<h3>Bower in PulseTile</h3>

<p>Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading,
    and saving the stuff youâ€™re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file,
    <a href="https://github.com/PulseTile/PulseTile/blob/develop/bower.json">bower.json</a>.</p>
