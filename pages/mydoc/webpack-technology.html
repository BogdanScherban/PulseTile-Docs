# Webpack

Webpack is a powerful module bundler. A bundle is a JavaScript file that incorporates assets that belong together and should be served to the client in a response to a single file request. A bundle can include JavaScript, CSS styles, HTML, and almost any other kind of file.
Webpack roams over your application source code, looking for import statements, building a dependency graph, and emitting one or more bundles. With plugins and rules, Webpack can preprocess and minify different non-JavaScript files such as TypeScript, SASS, and LESS files.
You determine what Webpack does and how it does it with a JavaScript configuration file, webpack.config.js.

# Usage within PulseTile

We are using WebPack to create a bundle file from all the src's we do have, to create a single HTML and JS file, that the application uses while built. Example of our webpack.config.js is found within the <a href="https://github.com/PulseTile/PulseTile/blob/develop/webpack.config.js">sources root folder</a>
