Basic instructions to get PulseTile installed on your local machine to explore is available here in [https://github.com/PulseTile/PulseTile/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/PulseTile/PulseTile/blob/master/README.md)

**NB** Note that the PulseTile Framework is easiest to understand/experiment with in the context of a wider healthcare stack.

Please check out the [Ripple Foundation Showcase Stack Documentation](http://docs-showcase.ripple.foundation/) for a better understanding of PulseTile in that context.
One of the features available is an install script that gets PulseTile up and running with a set of API provided test data ready to explore.
We recommend that newcomers to PulseTile quickly install PulseTile as part of this showcase stack.

Please let us know if/how we can help make the install process easier for you.
