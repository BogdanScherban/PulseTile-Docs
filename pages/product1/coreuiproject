### Licensing  
**Q: Revisit the ISC Licence of the UI project, and discuss whether it is the right one to use and whether Tony has any preference**   
**A:** The UI code will follow the Java middleware and use an Apache 2.0 licence.  

***

**Q: Should we be providing a copyright notice at the top of each file? We do this in the middleware because it’s possible, with its open Apache 2.0 licence, for organisations to take a copy of the codebase and start developing on top of it. It’s important to show which files are copyrighted by the RippleOSI organisation so that people don’t publish the Ripple code as their own.**         
**A:** We added a copyright notice to the top of each file.

### Documentation

**Q: It would be useful to have a write up of an architectural document of the UI project and the plugin loading and configuration, complete with diagrams and explanations of the role of webpack and redux.**   
**A:** Tony has instructed SliceArt to complete a high level structural diagram of the Ripple UI component architecture. When the development is nearing completion, a full document should be provided in order to describe how Redux, Webpack, the Core Ripple UI, and the plugins all interact and communicate with each other.
