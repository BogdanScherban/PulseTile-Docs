<h3>RxJS</h3>

<p>
	RxJS is one of the popular libraries in web development today.
	It offers a powerful, functional approach for dealing with events and with integration
	points into a growing number of frameworks, libraries, and utilities.
</p>
<p>
	With observables we can easily manage asynchronous data streams in React.
	The Observer and Observable interfaces provide a generalized mechanism for push-based notifications,
	also known as the observer design pattern.
	Stated another way RxJS is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous
	and event-based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators.
</p>

<h4>Here are the benefits of using RxJS:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Greater separation of concerns between component presentation and component logic.</li>
	<li>Component description is more consistent.</li>
	<li>
		RxJS processes huge data sets in arrays and does not need to organize step-by-step processing of this data,
		you can use RxJS operators as something like transducers when they process these data sets without creating intermediate arrays.
	</li>
</ul>
