<p>
Within the pressure of 21st Century Healthcare, it is increasingly clear that the current health IT market needs major improvement. In particular we know that usability of current health IT systems is a real problem for many clinicians at the frontline, with moves such as the LetDoctorsBeDoctors campaign highlighting the poor "<a href="http://zdoggmd.com/ehr-state-of-mind/">EHR state of mind</a>" and inadequacies of the current state of the Health IT market.
</p>
 
<p>
As we build towards an open platform stack we acknowledge that usability and integration are our first and second guiding principles of our technical approach. In a <a href="http://rippleosi.org/introduction-to-the-ripple-stack-uiux/">previous article we took a high level view of our PulseTile UI framework</a>. We are now going to step "into the mind" and explain the rationale behind this user-centred design.
</p>

We have, <a href="http://rippleosi.org/introduction-to-the-ripple-stack-uiux/">in our earlier UI/UX post, explored the three key levels </a>within our stack, aimed at:
<ul>
 	<li>Single Patient Views</li>
 	<li>Multiple Patient Views</li>
 	<li>Clinical/Business Intelligence Views</li>
</ul>
We now look in detail at the key <strong>Single Patient View</strong> which is the key tool to support the patient/clinician encounter.

<em>Clinical Healthcare IT tools need to be real easy to use otherwise they're getting in the way</em>

The guiding principle here is to find key common patterns across Health IT that are intuitive to use, yet can support any clinical scenario.

We introduce key elements in the UI framework, based on earlier <a href="http://frectal.com/2015/06/30/clinuip-clinical-ui-patterns-an-update/">ClinUiP</a> work, which we can explain in four key areas of the UI. (These are explained in the context of a typical desktop configuration, though a responsive mobile design is also supported, which we will be explaining later.)
<ul>
 	<li>North - for Context: where is the user,where to search</li>
 	<li>West - for Navigation: how to move around the application</li>
 	<li>Centre - for Summary/tables on key information</li>
 	<li>East - for Detail of any/all patient information</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>
In the context of our PulseTile implementation of this design pattern we can see these principles in action:
<br>

<a href="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IDCR_allergy_v2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1325 size-large" src="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IDCR_allergy_v2-1024x510.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="510" /></a>

<br><br>
<strong>North - Context</strong>

Patient Banner, based on the work of the NHS Common User Interface effort, with easy to read patient information
<br><br>
<strong>West - Navigation</strong>

The patient record can become a large and complex thing so we have structured the record in line with those key headings that most closely relate to the core clinical process, as those of us were taught in medical school will recognise.
<ul>
 	<li>Problems/Diagnosis</li>
 	<li>Medications</li>
 	<li>Allergy/Adverse Reactions</li>
 	<li>Orders</li>
 	<li>Results</li>
 	<li>Procedures etc etc</li>
</ul>
Structuring the record along these lines allows the clinician to navigate in their natural clinical order, yet also work in a non linear way as required.

<br><br>
<strong>Centre - Summary</strong>
This table approach allows us to offer a brief summary view of key data (Problems/Diagnosis, Medications etc) at a glance, with just enough information to be useful but not too much. Here we provide a simple filter to allow quick searching through the tables.

At the bottom of the table is the option to create/add further data. This is a key design point, the user is encouraged to explore existing information before adding further detail. As integration is built into the design philosophy, the existing information from a range of existing systems may be available here, along with the source system, which gives important information about the provenance of the information available.
This is useful on two counts.
<ul>
 	<li>Firstly it is easier and faster to read information than enter it de novo, so encouraging this good practice engenders more efficient information management.</li>
 	<li>Secondly it aims to reduce any unnecessary duplication of medications, investigations etc, by ensuring existing patient information is made available at the point of care.</li>
</ul>
While this approach supports the user exploring existing patient information, de novo data entry is supported via a Create Button at the bottom of the table.

<br><br>
<strong>East - Detail</strong>
In this panel any/all detail can be made available to the clinician. Much of the time this information will be read only, though occasionally the data may be editable from this point (via Edit button which triggers the related Edit view to appear).

<br><br>
<strong>Edit/Modal- Data Entry/Edit</strong>
For data entry/edit purposes, we offer a Edit/modal window for real time entry/editing. We commend this design choice for two reasons:
<ul>
 	<li>A Edit/Modal approach allows us to accommodate a wide range of UI widgets for the challenging of effective data entry, including external components.</li>
 	<li>A Modal approach allows us to hook/harness any number of UI widgets together in any particular sequence to accommodate the diversity of clinical pathways seen in healthcare.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Hopefully further detail on the rationale behind our UI framework helps explains the simple yet scalable principles involved in the PulseTile UX/UI framework.
Simply put the approach borrows heavily from many web applications that we use day in and day out (e.g. GMail as just one example ) to minimize the need for training yet is able to handle both access to legacy data plus de novo data entry.
</p>
<p> 
We outline and offer this open source framework as a generic UX/UI framework for healthcare IT application purposes, to encourage further development and redevelopment.
Feedback of all sorts is very welcome. Indeed if/when you identify a more flexible open source UI framework for healthcare please do let us know!

<b>Healthcare IT : The Search for Usability</b>

As we build the components of the Ripple platform, one of the main drivers behind our approach is to quickly get stuff out there that folk can see, touch and work with.  The principles of User Centred Design and Agile Development are key to our philosophy and way of working. Having been involved in related projects for many years, one of the key issues I've come across in healthcare IT is the importance of usability. In fact, in my opinion (and several other colleagues I know) it’s the number one issue to get right in health IT.

In an earlier article on "<a href="http://frectal.com/2014/06/30/21stc-healthcare-open-platform/">21st Century Healthcare, the Open Platform that will Transform</a>" of the three key features listed: -  Usability, Integration and Clinical Kernel -  Usability was the first priority. Its fair to say that usability has not been a strong feature of health IT and one can even cite the unusual arrangement with "<a href="http://frectal.com/2014/03/31/ehr-hardship-exception-fix-usability/">Hardship Exceptions</a>" in the US Health IT market to illustrate the major issue/problem this is for many users.

Indeed, within the US, an industry of scribes has grown and proliferated to support clinicians at the frontline as the process of clinical documentation into EHR systems has become so cumbersome that doctors need an assistant to support them. This raises a raft of <a href="http://frectal.com/book/">people, process and technology issues that I've explored elsewhere </a>but it suffices to say health IT usability (that is the User Interface UI and User Experience UX) could be better.

<b>If Steve Jobs were still around…</b>

If the late, legendary Steve Jobs was still on the planet, I think someone of his ilk could help us strip down this challenge and change the healthcare world, much as other industries have been transformed.  Healthcare is waiting for the right, highly usable platform that makes this all so much easier.

Of course this is non trivial to do, otherwise it would have been cracked by now. In my own opinion, many of the previous attempts to tackle this have over complicated their analysis and the related solutions, which then look busy, cluttered and hard to navigate. Some have taken bits of this challenge and undertaken very nice work to address part of the solution (eg<a href="http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/cui"> NHS Common User Interface</a> or<a href="http://healthdesignchallenge.com/"> Healthcare Design Challenge</a> efforts). These look good in isolation but don't form or offer a holistic whole, a user interface framework that can be a key part of the platform that healthcare needs.

<b>Introducing the Ripple UI framework</b>

So where better to start exploring the Ripple Stack than at the front end, the User Interface framework, the look and feel.

With the challenge of great usability in mind, we have set about our agile efforts with our Ripple platform demonstrator. Building on learning from several phases of earlier work (including PPM+,<a href="http://www.leedscarerecord.org/"> Leeds Care Record</a>,<a href="http://clinuip.wordpress.com/"> ClinUiP</a>,<a href="http://frectal.com/2013/12/30/2-clinicians-2-developers-20-days-agile-development-towards-nhs-vista/"> and NHS VistA</a>), we have quickly developed and deployed our Ripple UI framework as part of our Integrated Digital Care Record demonstrator.

The principles behind the framework are very simple - deliberately so and can be explained as follows:

The simplicity of the approach is based on a set of key patterns that we have learned from our time in this field.<a href="http://frectal.com/book/chaos-complex-complicated-simple-and-cynefin/"> Patterns are key to understanding complex adaptive systems</a> such as healthcare and healthcare IT. If the right patterns are spotted they can be harnessed to powerful effect.

<b>So lets talk patterns</b>

The Ripple UI framework ties three key levels of people/process/info tech into three key layers.

I've also used a picture before to explain these three layers in healthcare.

<a href="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CoreProcessLayers1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-727 " src="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CoreProcessLayers1.jpg" alt="A diagram of the core process layers" width="755" height="566" /></a>

For too long, the people, process and information technology between these three layers have been either kept apart and/or not worked well together or indeed the focus has been on one aspect to the detriment to the others.

In many places different teams use different processes and different tools to address these issues and very little is seamless. In other places, the focus may have been on aggregating information for billing or performance management, which has involved an army of staff digesting paper notes to feed this management reporting, while the frontline staff struggle with the same paper based tools.

<b>A day in the life of one Clinician and three Clicks</b>

So imagine this:

A senior clinician (doctor, nurse or other care professional) starts her week by looking at the community based service she leads and is responsible for (e.g. older Patients over 80 years old), she should be able to see the capacity of and demands on that service in real time. How else can she lead it and oversee it?

<a href="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-05-51.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-717 size-large" src="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-05-51-1024x496.png" alt="screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com 2015-06-25 16-05-51" width="1024" height="496" /></a>

With the right tools she can see where the main pressures point are and where she needs to focus her attention. With one click she should be able to see a related view of each patient journey.

Imagine that same clinician overseeing the service starts her day in a clinical area of older patients that is under pressure and is able to look across that cohort of patients at different stages of the treatment and assessment of their condition, and because the same tool provides real time information about that particular group of patients, she can pick out the most in need of her attention.

<a href="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-10-15.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-718 size-large" src="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-10-15-1024x467.png" alt="Screen shot of the patient dashboard" width="1024" height="467" /></a>

With one click she can to see a view of that patient’s condition and care.

Finally, that same clinician approaches the patient, sits with her, introduces herself and begins to talk to the lady about her own story.  The clinician has the information tools to examine the patient’s past medical history, her medications, allergies, clinic letters and much more, pulling related information from across the care system to ensure she is well informed as she takes over the patient’s care. If she needs further investigation (e.g. a blood test), treatment (e.g. a medication) or a referral to a colleague it will  be only a click away.

<a href="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-20-25.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-723 size-large" src="http://rippleosi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/screenshot-idcr-poc-uat.answerappcloud.com-2015-06-25-16-20-25-1024x459.png" alt="screenshot of the patient dashboard " width="1024" height="459" /></a>

These principles and the three clicks help explain the first three patterns behind our PulseTile UX/UI stack. As a picture tells a 1000 words we've include just three related screenshots to bring that theory and story to life.
